# Python For Linux Admin

You have been asked to create a couple of utility tools in Python ( mixed with Bash) to make your life as a Linux Admin a lot easier. You will be using Python 2.x running on Linux
.
Some of the solutions you will be creating include

- 1] Cleanup script to look after old and unwanted files
- 2] CGI utility users can interact with to perform a task
- 3] script to sift through logs and provide aggregation or summary
- 4] report mechanisms via email and text messages.

Note:  You need a Linux machine running Python 2.x , with access to the Internet. Class is fully hands on.
